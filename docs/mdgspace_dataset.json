Once triggered, the system connects to a paired mobile app that handles critical actions—sharing location, sending alerts to emergency contacts, and logging events. By removing reliance on internal wiring or external triggers like buttons or voice commands, Suraksha enables discreet, intuitive, and reliable activation, even under stress or physical constraint."
